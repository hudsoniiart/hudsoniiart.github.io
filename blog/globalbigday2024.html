			<p>Like last year, I went birding with Westman Naturalists on Global Big Day and saw a good number of species.</p>
			
			<h2>Riverbank Discovery Centre</h2>
			
			<p>Five of us met at the parking lot for an 08:30 start (I was also awake between 02:00 and 05:00 for the <a href="../photo/nightsky/superstorm2024">aurora borealis</a>). A Brown-headed Cowbird landed close behind us, and a Swainson's Hawk watched us as we watched some small sandpipers. Pairs of Tree Swallows were checking out nest boxes along the trail.</p>
			
			<h2>Griswold Marsh</h2>
			
			<p>Along the Grand Valley Rd we had a few Turkey Vultures, and two American Avocet next to the highway interchange. At the marsh area south of Griswold there were lots of ducks and gulls. Two White-faced Ibis and an American White Pelican were hiding amongst the reeds.</p>
			
			<h2>Hanbury Hill</h2>
			
			<p>With another Westman Naturalist member I walked down and back up Hanbury Hill in Brandon. We saw several warblers, high up in the trees but almost at eye level thanks to the path along the side of the ravine. I also got decent shots of a Swainson's Thrush and Blue Jay.</p>
